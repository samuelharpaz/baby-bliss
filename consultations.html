              Alongside the full workshops, I offer a one-on-one strategy session/consultation (up to 90 minutes).
              During this session, we discuss your specific needs and situation, and create a practical, personalized
              plan to help you reach your goals as quickly and efficiently as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The strategy session is designed as a single, focused session and does not include ongoing support. When
              we first connect, we can determine whether this option will meet your needs or if the full workshop would
              be more beneficial.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every situation is unique, and it's usually helpful to have a brief discussion in order to determine which
              option makes the most sense.

              Some moms have just a few specific issues to address and don't require the investment of a whole course.
              In addition, certain situations aren't well suited to the full workshop model. For example, once a baby is
              past a certain age, implementing the workshop methods in the standard way can be difficult. Instead, it
              will require identifying and reshaping specific habits in order to get things back on track. Additionally,
              some babies have special circumstances that make a structured schedule impractical, or other specific
              needs where the standard method may not be as effective and a more personalized approach is required.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, many situations require a deeper understanding of the full method to be truly
              effective, and the ongoing support provided with the full workshops will often be critical to achieving
              success.
