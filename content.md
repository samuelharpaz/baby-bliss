# Naava Lindner

Hi, I’m Naava —a grateful mother of 8, a (young) grandmother, and a dedicated sleep consultant passionate about helping families thrive. My journey into sleep consulting began with my own parenting struggles and a deep desire to give my children the best.

When I first became a mother, I made a silent vow: I would put my baby girl first, always! I catered to her on demand, feeding her whenever she cried, holding her close throughout the night and letting her schedule dictate my day. At the time, I believed this was the ultimate expression of love.

The idea of schedules or routines seemed cold and unloving, far from the nurturing mother I wanted to be.

I didn’t grow up surrounded by babies, so my first real introduction to parenting came after I got married and moved to Israel. There, I observed two parenting styles—mothers who followed strict schedules and who said things like, “I can’t feed my baby right now—it’s not the right time.” And mothers who kept their babies as close as possible, responding to every sound or hint of discomfort. I admired the latter and modeled my parenting after it.

But by the time my fourth baby arrived, I couldn’t keep up with the demands of a newborn, three other children, and life’s many responsibilities. I was overwhelmed, sleep-deprived, and questioning if I was failing as a mom.

It was during this overwhelming time that a friend introduced me to The Happiest Baby on the Block by Dr. Harvey Karp, where I learned calming techniques like swaddling and soothing. Fascinated by these solutions, I began learning everything I could about baby care— eating, digesting, playtime, and sleeping.

While these approaches provided a strong foundation, I saw baby care is not a one-size-fits-all secret. I adapted what I learned to align with my values and my family’s unique needs. And for the first time, I saw that caring for a baby didn’t have to be all or nothing.

As I implemented these methods with my own children, everything shifted. For the first time, I started to really learn and understand what my baby was saying. This transformation became the foundation of my approach to sleep training.

My babies became calmer and more content, and naturally I was more rested and confident.. Friends and family noticed the change and started asking for my advice. At first, I didn’t think much of it—I was just doing what worked for me. Until one friend said, “Naava, you have a system—it works, and you need to help other moms,”

And so, my journey as a sleep consultant began. By the time I had my sixth baby, I had developed an intuitive understanding of infant cues. I wasn’t guessing what they wanted—I could read my baby’s cues before they even cried. I knew what they wanted before they asked.

I learned It wasn’t about choosing rigid schedules or self-sacrifice—it was about finding balance. A gentle, nurturing approach that meets a baby’s needs while also creating structure and ensuring you get the rest necessary to be the best parent you can be.

### My approach

I’m here because I understand the exhaustion, the doubt, and desperation for guidance. I also know the peace and joy that come when you find a rhythm that works for both you and your baby. There’s no “one-size-fits-all” solution when it comes to baby care. My methods are rooted in evidence-based practices, but I always honor your role as the expert on your baby.

My approach focuses on meeting you where you are, understanding your unique needs, and crafting a personalized plan that fits seamlessly into your family’s life.

Together, we’ll look at how eating, playing, and sleep are interconnected, and I’ll teach you how to recognize your baby’s cues to create gentle routines that help them thrive.

### My Mission

The period following birth is a transformative time for both mother and baby, filled with unique challenges and profound joys. With the right support and nurturing, this can be one of the most beautiful chapters in a mother’s life as she bonds with her precious new child. Together, they learn to navigate this new world, understand each other’s cues, and blend their energies into a harmonious unit.

When mothers receive the encouragement and support they need to recover physically and emotionally from labor, the result is an overflow of strength that empowers them to care for their newborn—who relies on them for everything.

### Empowering families

My goal is to coach women and their husbands on recognizing and meeting these essential needs. I believe in empowering fathers to understand their vital role as supportive husbands and fathers, fostering a collaborative environment that nurtures both partners. I guide mothers on self-care strategies that facilitate recovery from childbirth, helping them regain their strength while ensuring they are emotionally fulfilled. This holistic approach enables mothers to continue giving love and support to their families.

Together, parents will learn crucial skills for establishing a positive rhythm with their baby—a predictable routine that brings comfort and joy to family life. If there are older siblings, I emphasize the importance of involving them in this beautiful process, ensuring everyone feels included and valued.

### Practical Techniques for Success

I share practical techniques with couples, such as calming a fussy baby and using these moments as opportunities to teach self-regulation skills. Babies have immature nervous systems that benefit from gentle guidance during these challenging episodes.

Creating a flexible yet predictable routine is incredibly beneficial on multiple levels. Babies quickly learn what to expect, which fosters a sense of security. Mothers gain clarity on when they will feed their baby and when they can carve out much-needed “me time” for activities like cooking, shopping, or even enjoying a relaxing shower.

Having a structure can also reduce issues like colic or periods of distress for the baby, allowing everyone to enjoy restful sleep. And for nursing mothers, establishing a routine helps regulate their bodies, leading to greater comfort.
