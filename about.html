            <p>
              Hi! I'm Naava&mdash;a grateful mother of 8, a (young) grandmother, and a dedicated sleep consultant
              passionate about helping families thrive.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey into sleep consulting began with my own parenting struggles and a deep desire to give my
              children the best.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I first became a mother, I made a silent vow: I would put my baby girl first, always! I catered to
              her on demand, feeding her whenever she cried, holding her close throughout the night and letting her
              schedule dictate my day. At the time, I believed this was the ultimate expression of love.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea of schedules or routines seemed cold and unloving, far from the nurturing mother I wanted to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn't grow up surrounded by babies, so my first real introduction to parenting came after I got married
              and moved to Israel.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-2">
            <img src="/images/naava-about.jpg" alt="Naava" class="img-naava-about" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <div class="text-container">
            <p>
              There, I observed two parenting styles—mothers who followed strict schedules and who said things like, “I
              can't feed my baby right now&mdash;it's not the right time.” And mothers who kept their babies as close as
              possible, responding to every sound or hint of discomfort. I admired the latter and modeled my parenting
              after it.
            </p>
            <p>
              But by the time my fourth baby arrived, I couldn't keep up with the demands of a newborn, three other
              children, and life's many responsibilities. I was overwhelmed, sleep-deprived, and questioning if I was
              failing as a mom.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was during this overwhelming time that a friend introduced me to
              <em>The Happiest Baby on the Block</em> by Dr. Harvey Karp, where I learned calming techniques like
              swaddling and soothing. Fascinated by these solutions, I began learning everything I could about baby
              care— eating, digesting, playtime, and sleeping.
            </p>
            <p>
              While these approaches provided a strong foundation, I saw baby care is not a one-size-fits-all secret. I
              adapted what I learned to align with my values and my family's unique needs. And for the first time, I saw
              that caring for a baby didn't have to be all or nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I implemented these methods with my own children, everything shifted. For the first time, I started to
              really learn and understand what my baby was saying. This transformation became the foundation of my
              approach to sleep training.
            </p>
            <p>
              My babies became calmer and more content, and naturally I was more rested and confident.. Friends and
              family noticed the change and started asking for my advice. At first, I didn't think much of it—I was just
              doing what worked for me. Until one friend said, “Naava, you have a system&mdash;it works, and you need to
              help other moms!”
            </p>
            <p>
              And so, my journey as a sleep consultant began. By the time I had my sixth baby, I had developed an
              intuitive understanding of infant cues. I wasn't guessing what they wanted—I could read my baby's cues
              before they even cried. I knew what they wanted before they asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned It wasn't about choosing rigid schedules or self-sacrifice—it was about finding balance. A
              gentle, nurturing approach that meets a baby's needs while also creating structure and ensuring you get
              the rest necessary to be the best parent you can be.

                  I'm here because I understand the exhaustion, the doubt, and desperation for guidance. I also know the
                  peace and joy that come when you find a rhythm that works for both you and your baby. There's no
                  “one-size-fits-all” solution when it comes to baby care. My methods are rooted in evidence-based
                  practices, but I always honor your role as the expert on your baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My approach focuses on meeting you where you are, understanding your unique needs, and crafting a
                  personalized plan that fits seamlessly into your family's life.

                <p>
                  Together, we'll look at how eating, playing, and sleep are interconnected, and I'll teach you how to
                  recognize your baby's cues to create gentle routines that help them thrive.

                  The period following birth is a transformative time for both mother and baby, filled with unique
                  challenges and profound joys. With the right support and nurturing, this can be one of the most
                  beautiful chapters in a mother's life as she bonds with her precious new child. Together, they learn
                  to navigate this new world, understand each other's cues, and blend their energies into a harmonious
                  unit.

                  My goal is to coach women and their husbands on recognizing and meeting these essential needs. I
                  believe in empowering fathers to understand their vital role as supportive husbands and fathers,
                  fostering a collaborative environment that nurtures both partners. I guide mothers on self-care
                  strategies that facilitate recovery from childbirth, helping them regain their strength while ensuring
                  they are emotionally fulfilled. This holistic approach enables mothers to continue giving love and
                  support to their families.

                  Together, parents will learn crucial skills for establishing a positive rhythm with their baby—a
                  predictable routine that brings comfort and joy to family life. If there are older siblings, I
                  emphasize the importance of involving them in this beautiful process, ensuring everyone feels included
                  and valued.

                  I share practical techniques with couples, such as calming a fussy baby and using these moments as
                  opportunities to teach self-regulation skills. Babies have immature nervous systems that benefit from
                  gentle guidance during these challenging episodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Creating a flexible yet predictable routine is incredibly beneficial on multiple levels. Babies
                  quickly learn what to expect, which fosters a sense of security. Mothers gain clarity on when they
                  will feed their baby and when they can carve out much-needed “me time” for activities like cooking,
                  shopping, or even enjoying a relaxing shower.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having a structure can also reduce issues like colic or periods of distress for the baby, allowing
                  everyone to enjoy restful sleep. And for nursing mothers, establishing a routine helps regulate their
                  bodies, leading to greater comfort.
